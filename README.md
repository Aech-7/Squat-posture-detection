 Wearable Squat Posture Detection Device

 This project involves a wearable thigh-mounted device designed to analyze squat posture and provide real-time feedback. Using an IMU sensor, the device captures Euler angle data to determine whether the squat form falls within an acceptable range. Data from 15-20 individuals was recorded and analyzed to establish this threshold. An Arduino Uno processes the sensor data and controls a buzzer and multicolored LEDs, offering immediate feedback to guide users toward proper squat technique. This ensures safer workouts by reducing the risk of incorrect posture and potential injuries.
